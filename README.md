# Panopto Resizer
Panopto Resizer is an extension made for the panopto video streaming service, that allows users to resize the ratio between the left and right window. This is only tested with videos with two screens. The package is not made public. Tested with Google Chrome and Firefox, with fedora 35. Does not work for clean chromium (Panopto not supported).
