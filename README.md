# Panopto Resizer
Panopto Resizer is an extension made for the panopto video streaming service, that allows users to resize the ratio between the left and right window. This is only tested with videos with two screens. The package is not made public. Works with Google Chrome, with fedora 35, and probably more. Does not work for clean chromium (Panopto not supported), or firefox (non-signed extensions not supported).

### How to
Press "A" and "D" to resize the screen. Resize the screen if any graphical bugs appear. If this doesn't fix the problem, reload the page.
